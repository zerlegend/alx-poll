# Testing Authentication Flow

## Current Issue
The "Please log in to create polls" error indicates that the user is not authenticated when trying to create a poll.

## Steps to Test Authentication

### 1. Check if you're logged in
- Look at the top navigation bar
- If you see "Login" and "Register" buttons, you're not logged in
- If you see "Create Poll" and a user avatar, you're logged in

### 2. Log in or Register
- Click "Register" to create a new account
- Or click "Login" if you already have an account
- Fill in your email and password
- Complete the authentication process

### 3. Test Poll Creation
- After logging in, click "Create Poll" in the navigation
- Fill out the poll form
- Submit the poll

### 4. Debug Information
The console will show:
- Authentication state in the browser console
- Session information in the server logs
